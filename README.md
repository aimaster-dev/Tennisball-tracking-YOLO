# Real-Time-Tennis-Ball-Tracking-in-Bad-Angle
This is repository for tracking real time tennis ball tracking in bad angle. Because the camera located to behind of playground, the ball become smaller when one player kick the ball. Also the ball become lager whe other player kick the ball. So the size of ball is changing always and it's difficult to detect. I used YOLOv8 and sahi.
